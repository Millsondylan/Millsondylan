## About Me
- Builder of AI agent tooling and cross-platform assistants with a focus on resilient integrations and fast feedback loops.
- Oct 26-27, 2025: delivered 17 release-hardening commits for the private `homebrew-forge` packaging repo, stabilizing cryptography wheels and OAuth flows.
- Oct 25-Nov 1, 2025: led 19 commits in the private `JOURNAL_CURRENT` super-app (Flutter + Supabase) to finish OAuth audits and environment automation.
- Oct 14, 2025: added YOLO mode and routing safeguards to the official `gemini-cli`, enabling continuous execution inside the terminal-native assistant workflow.
- Run measurable delivery: every push feeds through multi-platform GitHub Actions pipelines, GoReleaser builds, or staged mobile deploys.
