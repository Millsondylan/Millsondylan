## About Me
- Builder of AI agent tooling and cross-platform assistants with a focus on resilient integrations and fast feedback loops.
- Oct 27-30, 2025: shipped 29 fixes in `opencode`, tightening Claude 4.5 validation, Anthropic/OpenAI model routing, and documentation hygiene.
- Oct 26-27, 2025: delivered 17 release-hardening commits for the private `homebrew-forge` packaging repo, stabilizing cryptography wheels and OAuth flows.
- Oct 25-Nov 1, 2025: led 19 commits in the private `JOURNAL_CURRENT` super-app (Flutter + Supabase) to finish OAuth audits and environment automation.
- Run measurable delivery: every push feeds through multi-platform GitHub Actions pipelines, GoReleaser builds, or staged mobile deploys.

## Projects
- **[opencode](https://github.com/Millsondylan/opencode)** · 2025-current · Go-based agent runner coordinating Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama providers with Bubble Tea + Cobra UX. Recent work delivered Claude 4.5 parity, stronger validation layers, and leaner documentation.
- **[forge](https://github.com/Millsondylan/forge)** · 2025-current · Python CLI for self-managing agents featuring a full-screen studio, model routing, and Homebrew distribution. Integrates Rich, Click, and Anthropic SDK for rapid operator workflows.
- **Private · JOURNAL_CURRENT** · 2024-current · Cross-platform journaling super-app built with Flutter, Supabase, and Kotlin native bridges. Latest sprint automated environment checks, enforced Stack Auth security, and stabilized staging deploys.
- **Private · AI_GLASSES** · 2024-current · Multimodal wearable assistant blending a Python edge pipeline with React Native mobile surfaces; October releases added structured logging, consent screens, and summarization upgrades.
- **Private · ALGO** · 2024-current · FastAPI trading automation stack with JWT-secured auth, Ruff/MyPy enforced CI, and containerized deploy targets; current focus is stabilizing pipelines after auth refactors.
- **[deepseek-api](https://github.com/Millsondylan/deepseek-api)** · 2025 · Docker-first, OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek bridge tuned for Render's free tier, bundling auth, rate limits, and observability hooks.
