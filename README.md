## Projects
- **[opencode](https://github.com/Millsondylan/opencode)** · 2025-current · Go-based agent runner coordinating Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama providers with Bubble Tea and Cobra-driven UX. Recent work delivered Claude 4.5 parity, stronger validation layers, and leaner documentation.
- **[forge](https://github.com/Millsondylan/forge)** · 2025-current · Python CLI for self-managing agents featuring a full-screen studio, model routing, and Homebrew distribution. Integrates Rich, Click, and Anthropic SDK for rapid operator workflows.
- **[homebrew-forge](https://github.com/Millsondylan/homebrew-forge)** · 2025-current · Packaging companion that aligns Brew, pip, and OAuth flows; October sprints hardened cryptography wheels, formula metadata, and deployment docs.
- **[deepseek-api](https://github.com/Millsondylan/deepseek-api)** · 2025 · Docker-first, OpenAI-compatible DeepSeek bridge tuned for Render's free tier, bundling auth, rate limits, and observability hooks.
